# AzerothCore Management Console (1.0.0)
Allows you to manage your AzerothCore server with a text based UI - 


---

Edit "azmc" and change the settings at the top if your AzerothCore server is not in /home/wowowner/azerothcore

I suggest you then add this to your /home/wowowner/.bashrc file:

	export PATH=/home/wowowner/bin:/home/wowowner/Azerothcore-Manager:$PATH

You will need to install the required perl modules (as root):

- sudo /home/wowowner/Azerothcore-Manager/installdeps


After that you should log out and back in and now "azmc" should work.
